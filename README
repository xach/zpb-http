ZPB-HTTP is some old code I use to fetch data via HTTP. 

It includes an HTTP client and DNS resolver. It uses a hand-rolled
socket system rather than sb-bsd-sockets. It has an epoll interface.

I wrote it because I wanted more control over DNS and network
timeouts. It works only on SBCL + Linux.

Half-baked and undocumented. I am publishing it only to share ideas.
